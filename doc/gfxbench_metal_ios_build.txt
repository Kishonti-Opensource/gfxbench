1\. Software requirements
------------------------

	1. Xcode latest version
	2. CMake 3.5.0 (http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) or install from brew

2\. Build
---------

This package contains source code to build Corporate GFXBench Metal on iOS only.
To build use the following commands from the root of the package:

	PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Release ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh
	PRODUCT_VERSION=5.0 BUNDLE_DATA=false PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Release APPLICATION_TYPE="gui" ./scripts/build.sh

The above will build a Release ios project. The xcodeproj will be located at: `out/build/ios/app_ios/app_ios.xcodeproj`.

To build a Debug version of the project use `CONFIG=Debug` before the commands.

	PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Debug ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh
	BUNDLE_DATA=false PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Debug APPLICATION_TYPE="gui" ./scripts/build.sh

To build the testfw app version of the project use the following commands:

	PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Debug ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh
	PLATFORM=ios CONFIG=Debug APPLICATION_TYPE="developer" EXTRA_RESOURCE_DIRS="${PWD}/tfw-pkg/config;${PWD}/tfw-pkg/data" ./scripts/build.sh

In the generated XCode project set the active target to `app_ios`.

Edit the scheme of the `app_ios` target and select the same Build Configuration (Debug/Release) that has been used in the build script.


3\. Important notes
-------------------

If the build is failed on 10.12 Beta, and the note is:

	Check dependencies
	Signing for app_ios requires a development team. Select a development team in the Target Editor.
	Code signing is required for product type 'Application' in SDK 'iOS 10.0'

Open the Xcode project and set up the code signing manually.
