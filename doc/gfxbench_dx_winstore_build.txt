1\. Software requirements
-------------------------

    1. BASH environment (e.g.: Git Bash)
    2. Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 Update 2
    3. SQLite for Windows Runtime 8.1 v3.12.2
			https://sqlite.org/2016/sqlite-wp81-winrt-3120200.vsix
	4. CMake 3.4.0

2\. Build steps
---------------

This package contains source code to build Corporate GFXBenchDX.

First execute the 3rdParty build command via Git Bash, then execute the app build command with same `PLATFORM` and `CONFIG` parameters.
To build use the following commands from the root of the package:

Check the swig is added to `PATH`:  
e.g.: `export PATH=/c/tools/swigwin3:$PATH`

**3rdParty**

	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-arm CONFIG=Release ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh
	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-x86 CONFIG=Release ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh
	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-x64 CONFIG=Release ./scripts/build-3rdparty.sh

**APP**

	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-arm CONFIG=Release APPLICATION_TYPE=gui ./scripts/build.sh
	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-x86 CONFIG=Release APPLICATION_TYPE=gui ./scripts/build.sh
	WORKSPACE=${PWD} PLATFORM=v120_rt81-x64 CONFIG=Release APPLICATION_TYPE=gui ./scripts/build.sh

These scripts generate an MSVC solution for x86/x64/ARM platform and starts to compile it.
To build a Debug version of the project use the commands with `CONFIG=Debug` parameter.

**Note:**

- The generated Visual Studio solution will be placed into the following directory: `out/build/[platform]/app_winstore/StoreApp.sln`
- Do NOT run two buildscripts at the same time for the Windows Store and Windows Phone platform using the same source directory. Doing this might result in one or more of the builds failing as they use the same working directories relative to the source root!
- The developer application may not work

3\. How to use the MSVC solution
--------------------------------

In VS set `GFXBench.Windows` as a StartUp Project before running.

The WinRT application stores the temporary things here in development mode (in VS): 
`c:/Users/%YOUR_NAME%/AppData/Local/Packages/KishontiInformatics.GFXBench_%GUID%`
